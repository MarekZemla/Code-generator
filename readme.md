### A mini application that generates 1000 random / different codes.
### (click here to see how it works)[https://marekzemla.github.io/Code-generator/]
### //1.  I am creating a constant variable with characters that will be used to create the codes later
### //2.  I download the button and section
### //3. I create constant variables containing the number of codes that will be generated and how many characters each code will consist of.
### //4. I set the listening on on the button and assign a declared function to it
### //5. I'm building a declared function
### //6. I use loops for this
### //7. I am creating a constant variable div
### //8. I assign to constant variable div the value of constant variable code
### //9. Then I nest the div inside the section
### //10. I'm creating a code variable
### //11 It then uses another for loop inside the previous loop to randomly generate 10 characters to make up the code.
### // 12. I create a constant variable Index and assigns it to the method Math and multiplied by 20, because that's how many elements the variable chars has to hold a pool of characters.
### // 13. I assign variable chars to the constant variable code using incrementation at the same time
